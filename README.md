# Planner-Plus

## Description
Our motivation was to build a site that utilizes handlebars to simplify and sequelize data for users to keep track of a gift giving lift. We made this project to create a quick and easy way for users to keep track of a recipient, gift and budget. 

## Installation

Running the site is as simple as opening it in heroku. To grab the code to run locally it may be best to reinstall node_modules by doing an npm i, starting up the mysql database, run the seed with 'npm run seed', and starting up the server with 'node server.js' all in the terminal.

## Usage
To utilize the Gift Tracker site, input a recipient name, item and budget. The list will be generated on the homepage along with the functionality to add and delete.
